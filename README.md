# 📊 Conversion Rate Optimization with A/B Testing

This project presents an A/B Testing Analysis conducted on an Udacity E-commerce dataset.
It evaluates whether the Treatment group (new CTA design) improves conversion rates compared to the Control group.

# 📌 Project Overview

The A/B Test focuses on:

Measuring conversion rates between Control and Treatment groups

Performing a Proportion Test to check statistical significance

Visualizing conversion rate differences using bar charts

Drawing insights for decision-making in e-commerce optimization

# 📌 Key Features

Conversion Rate Analysis: Group-level performance metrics

Statistical Testing: Proportion test for hypothesis validation

Visualization: Clear bar charts comparing control vs. treatment

Business Insight: Identifying which CTA leads to better conversions

# 🛠 Tools & Technologies

Conversion Rate (Control): 12.0%

Conversion Rate (Treatment): 11.9%

p-value: 0.2182

# 📊 Interpretation:

Since p > 0.05, the result is not statistically significant.

The Control group outperformed Treatment, but the difference is due to chance.

✅ Recommendation: Continue with Control design.
